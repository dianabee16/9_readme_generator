# README Generator

This project uses a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file. It uses node.js to generate the file as well as node packages to carry out the work. The user will be asked a series of questions regarding title, description, installation, usage, contribution, tests, and lincense related to their project, and once answered a new README file will be generated.
